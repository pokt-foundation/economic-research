# How to contribute?

Once V1 is closer to mainnet launch, we will have an [extensive contribution guide](https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket/blob/18581335c954300915a668a6787553aa06b48344/docs/contributing/contribution/development.md) outlining all the steps to contribute, but if you just want to start getting involved, follow the next two steps:

1. Look at available work on [app.dework.xyz/pokt-network](https://app.dework.xyz/pokt-network) or look at our [starter tasks](https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22starter+task%22) / [community](https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22community%22+) tasks on Github.

2. Leave a comment on a Github issue, PR or connect with someone from the core team with "Pocket Core Contributor" role in the discord, to earn a contributor badge.
